                  <h3>1. What is Accreditation?</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;In the emerging age of information and knowledge, it is imperative
                    to ensure quality and purposefulness of our educational programs. Computing
                    professions, although young, are undoubtedly playing pivotal role in the
                    development of nations. The computing education in Pakistan being a recent
                    phenomenon needs direction, guidance, and mechanisms to achieve quality
                    standards. Accreditation processes are considered an effective instrument
                    to achieve these goals. Computing has emerged as a major academic discipline
                    and a professional field in Pakistan in the recent past. A large number
                    of educational institutions offer degree programs in computing related
                    areas both in public and private sectors. It has therefore become essential
                    that an internationally acceptable and industrially viable set of criteria
                    maybe evolved for various degree programs in computing related degree awarding
                    institutions. For this purpose, it is proposed that an accreditation authority
                    be setup which would periodically evaluate, scrutinize, and monitor the
                    standards followed in different degree awarding institutions and their
                    affiliated colleges. This authority shall be termed as the National Computing
                    Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC). The accreditation is to be used
                    to assure quality in computing degree programs in educational institutions.
                    It would require an educational institution or program to meet certain
                    defined standards or criteria. The accreditation will be for specific degree
                    programs and not institutions. Moreover, accreditation is not to be confused
                    with certification. In general, institutions and programs are accredited,
                    and individuals are certified. Accreditation protects and promotes the
                    interest of all stake holders, namely parents, students, faculty, academic
                    administrators, employers, and taxpayers. It serves to notify: Parents
                    and prospective students that a program has met minimum standards; Faculty,
                    deans and administrators of a program’s strengths and weaknesses and of
                    ways to improve the program; Employers that graduates are prepared to begin
                    professional practice; Taxpayers that their funds are spent well; and The
                    public that graduates are aware of public health and safety considerations.

                    ratings. The Commission shall help build capacity of existing councils
                    or bodies in order to enhance the reliability of the evaluation carried
                    out by them: and Whereas, now there is an urgent need for the constitution
                    of the National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC) for the
